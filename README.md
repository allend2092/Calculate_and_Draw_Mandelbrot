# Calculate_and_Draw_Mandelbrot
This Python program generates the Mandelbrot set using three different approaches:

Pure Python Implementation
Numba JIT-compiled Implementation
GPU-accelerated Implementation
Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

Importing Libraries
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib.pyplot for plotting
time for measuring execution time
numba for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and CUDA support
Pure Python Implementation (mandelbrot_python)
Takes parameters defining the region of the complex plane to visualize, the dimensions of the image, and the maximum number of iterations.
Uses nested loops to iterate over each pixel in the image.
For each pixel, it performs Mandelbrot set calculations.
Measures the execution time and plots the result.
Numba JIT-compiled Implementation (mandelbrot_numba)
Same as the pure Python implementation but uses Numba's @jit decorator for JIT compilation.
This speeds up the execution time.
GPU-accelerated Implementation (mandelbrot_gpu)
Uses Numba's CUDA support to run the Mandelbrot set calculations on the GPU.
Defines block and grid dimensions for parallel execution on the GPU.
Transfers the image array to GPU memory, performs the calculations, and then transfers it back to CPU memory.
Execution Time Measurement
Measures and prints the execution time for each approach.
Plotting
Uses matplotlib to plot the Mandelbrot set generated by each approach.
Summary
The program demonstrates how to generate the Mandelbrot set using pure Python, Numba JIT compilation, and GPU acceleration.
It also measures and prints the execution time for each approach to show the performance benefits of JIT compilation and GPU acceleration.
